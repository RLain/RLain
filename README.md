- 👋 Hi, I’m @RLain
- 👩‍💻 Working as a Developer at [Feed Me Seymour](https://www.linkedin.com/company/feed-me-seymour?originalSubdomain=uk){:target="_blank"} 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Typescript, Python & a little bit of C++ #Arduino
- 📫 How to reach me https://www.linkedin.com/in/rebecca-lain/

ℹ️ May 2024 after joining Feed Me Seymour - I moved from Github to Gitlab until August 2025. Hence the contribution disappearance 😉 ➡️ https://gitlab.com/rebecca.lain
Why the reduction in pushes from 2024 to 2025? I improved my push workflow to reduce unecessary pipeline executions:
